Javascript and D3

Is there a correlation between behavorial risk factors and economics? This project aims to answer that question while showcasing some interactive visualizations using JavaScript D3. The project uses data from the Census Bureau and CDC Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.


The data is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates: https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml. The current data set includes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state. MOE stands for "margin of error."
